Demo walkthrough script
-----------------------

1) Intro (10–15s)
- “This is a hybrid AI Dungeon Master prototype. The local model and rules decide intent and monster behavior. Gemini is only the narrator.”
- “You can see the local model outputs in the sidebar panel for transparency.”

2) Start the game (10s)
- Select 1–2 players and click Start Game.
- Point out the parchment styling, story log, and sidebar (location, party, dice log).

3) Quick actions (20–30s)
- Click “Explore” then “Talk” to show sensible outcomes and narration.
- Explain that Gemini (or fallback) narrates but never changes state or outcomes.

4) Typed inputs (30s)
- Type a fuzzy or nonsense input like “blorpfish??”. Show that the system still produces helpful narration and next steps via the rule-based engine.
- Type “attack the threat”. Show intent classified as “attack” and the monster behavior output.

5) Transparency (10s)
- Highlight the sidebar’s “Local Model Outputs”: intent label, confidence, and monster action.
- Emphasize: “Hybrid prototype: local model = rules/intent/monster; Gemini = narrator only.”

6) Wrap-up (10s)
- “The UI is designed to be teacher-proof: any input yields meaningful narrative. The ML part is visible, and Gemini is constrained to narration.”+
